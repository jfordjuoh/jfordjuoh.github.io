# Examples of Plotly
We are going to be looking at the NYC Restaurant inspection data. Restricted to American cuisine and SI to keep grade/critical_flag .

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(plotly)
library(p8105.datasets)
```

```{r}
data("rest_inspec") 

rest_inspec2 =
  rest_inspec %>%
  select(boro, cuisine_description, dba, zipcode, violation_code, violation_description, grade, grade_date) %>%
filter(boro == "Bronx")

#the filter thing was not working for me

```
